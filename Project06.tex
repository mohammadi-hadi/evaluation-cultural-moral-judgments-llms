\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across many tasks, but their ability to capture culturally diverse moral values remains unclear. In this paper, we examine whether LLMs can mirror variations in moral attitudes reported by two major cross-cultural surveys: the World Values Survey and the PEW Research Center’s Global Attitudes Survey. We compare smaller, monolingual, and multilingual models (GPT-2, OPT, BLOOMZ, and Qwen) with more recent instruction-tuned models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemma-2-9b-it, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct). Using log-probability-based~\emph{moral justifiability} scores, we correlate each model’s outputs with survey data covering a broad set of ethical topics. Our results show that many earlier or smaller models often produce near-zero or negative correlations with human judgments. In contrast, advanced instruction-tuned models (including GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) achieve substantially higher positive correlations, suggesting they better reflect real-world moral attitudes. While scaling up model size and using instruction tuning can improve alignment with cross-cultural moral norms, challenges remain for certain topics and regions. We discuss these findings in relation to bias analysis, training data diversity, and strategies for improving the cultural sensitivity of LLMs.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
Over the past few years, LLMs have gained prominence in both academic and public discussions~\citep{Bender2021}. Advances in model performance have made LLMs appealing for diverse applications, such as social media content moderation, chatbots, content creation, real-time translation, search engines, recommendation systems, and automated decision-making. While modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) show strong performance, a critical concern is how these models may inherit biases, including gender, racial, or cultural biases, from their training data. LLMs can easily absorb such biases because they learn from large-scale text corpora containing entrenched stereotypes~\citep{Staczak2021, karpouzis2024}.
%mishra2024 

These biases raise concerns about fairness, particularly in contexts requiring moral judgments. If an LLM is trained mostly on data that negatively or inaccurately portrays certain cultural groups, it may repeat that bias in its responses. As these models become more widespread and globally deployed, the risk of perpetuating cultural biases grows, especially when moral perspectives are different from common rules or what surveys usually show. In fact, recent research shows that current LLMs often exhibit a default Western-centric bias~\citep{adilazuarda2024towards}, underscoring the need to evaluate their cross-cultural validity



It is crucial to see whether LLMs accurately mirror the moral judgments observed across diverse cultures. Despite its importance, this issue has received limited attention~\citep{arora2023probing, liu2024multilingual}. Our study investigates whether both monolingual and multilingual Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) can capture nuanced cultural norms. These norms include subtle ethical differences across regions, for example, the acceptance of alcohol consumption or differing attitudes on topics like abortion. Although recent research suggests that multilingual PLMs might capture broader cultural nuances, they often fall short of reflecting the moral subtleties present in less dominant cultural groups~\citep{Hmmerl2022, papadopoulou2024}.

We examine this question using two well-known cross-cultural datasets: the World Values Survey (WVS)~\citep{Inglehart2014, Haerpfer2022}, and the PEW Research Center’s Global Attitudes Survey, which includes a module on moral issues across many countries~\citep{Pew2023}. These surveys offer a detailed view of moral and cultural norms globally, serving as a benchmark for comparing LLMs outputs against actual human responses. By converting survey questions into prompts, we derive log-probability-based~\emph{moral justifiability} scores. We then compare these scores with survey-based consensus on various ethical issues (e.g., drinking alcohol, sex before marriage, abortion, homosexuality), allowing us to see how closely different model types and training approaches align with cultural norms. Evaluating how effectively LLMs represent cultural values has both scholarly and practical significance. If a model systematically misrepresents or overlooks certain moral perspectives, it may reinforce stereotypes or lead to biased outcomes. On the other hand, more culturally aware models can highlight both shared values and nuanced disagreements, potentially contributing to more balanced dialogue. By comparing model outputs to reliable survey data, we identify areas where LLMs align with human values and highlight gaps in capturing diverse moral perspectives.

Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a structured probing framework that leverages carefully designed prompts, contrasting moral statements, and log-probability-based scoring to assess how LLMs assign~\emph{justifiability} values to morally complex scenarios across cultures. (2) We empirically analyze the alignment between LLM-derived moral scores and human survey responses using correlation and clustering, highlighting where models reflect or deviate from real-world moral judgments. (3) We extend our evaluation to state-of-the-art instruction-tuned and large-scale models, examining whether instruction tuning and scaling enhance alignment with cross-cultural moral norms. By identifying key strengths, weaknesses, and factors influencing model-human agreement, our work contributes to improving training data strategies, mitigating biases, and fostering the development of culturally aware language models. 


\section{Literature review}
%LLMs inherit biases present in their training data, and these biases can sometimes be amplified. Since LLMs are trained on extensive text corpora that reflect societal and cultural influences, they inevitably learn patterns that may reinforce existing disparities. This has raised concerns about fairness, representation, and the broader implications of deploying LLMs in real-world applications~\citep{Bender2021}.Moral judgments refer to evaluations of actions, intentions, or individuals as either acceptable or objectionable. These judgments vary widely by culture, shaped by religion, social norms, and historical factors~\citep{Haidt2001, Shweder1997}. 


%\paragraph{Biases and Moral Judgments in LLMs.}
LLMs inherit biases embedded in their training data, and these biases can be amplified upon large-scale deployment. Because the underlying corpora often reflect entrenched social hierarchies, models run the risk of reproducing or even intensifying unfair patterns. Recent work has underscored this from multiple perspectives, a 2025 study introduced a unified framework for transparency, fairness, and privacy in AI pipelines~\citep{Radanliev2025}, while an interdisciplinary survey emphasized the importance of \emph{diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)} as prerequisites for trustworthy AI~\citep{cachat2023diversity}. Taken together with earlier warnings about opaque language-model behaviors~\citep{Bender2021}, these findings illustrate the need for technical innovation to proceed hand-in-hand with social safeguards. In addition to high-level ethical governance, researchers are exploring concrete mitigation strategies. For example, LLM data augmentation has improved intent-classification accuracy without sacrificing fairness, provided that the augmentation is carefully curated~\citep{benayas2024enhancing}. Complementary work on adapter tuning for non-English LLMs shows that modest architectural modifications can substantially boost performance in culturally diverse benchmarks, thereby supporting more inclusive NLP systems~\citep{Zhou2024}.

Moral judgments themselves, evaluations of actions, intentions, or individuals as acceptable or objectionable, can differ widely by culture, shaped by religious traditions, social norms, and historical contexts~\citep{Haidt2001, Shweder1997}. Understanding how such pluralistic values are (or are not) embedded in contemporary LLMs remains a pressing research concern.  As noted by~\citet{Graham2016}, Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (W.E.I.R.D.) societies emphasize individual rights and autonomy, while non-W.E.I.R.D. societies often stress communal responsibilities and spiritual considerations. Consequently, people in W.E.I.R.D. cultures may view personal choices like sexual behavior as an individual right, while those in non-W.E.I.R.D. cultures consider them a collective moral concern. Although many moral values overlap across cultures, there are also areas of genuine divergence, often referred to as \emph{moral value pluralism}~\citep{Johnson2022, Benkler2023}. However,~\citet{Kharchenko2024} argue that LLMs struggle to capture pluralistic moral values because their training data lacks sufficient cultural variety. Likewise,~\citet{Du2024} point out that the heavy use of English data in LLMs training limits the representation and creativity of models in other languages, although larger training corpora and bigger model architectures can improve performance.~\citet{arora2023probing} suggest that multilingual LLMs could learn cultural values by incorporating multilingual data in their training. Yet, the limited diversity within multilingual corpora can still cause these models to perform inconsistently across languages and cultural contexts.~\citet{Benkler2023} emphasize that many current AI systems lean toward the dominant values of Western cultures, especially English-speaking ones, leading to an implicit assumption that W.E.I.R.D. values are universal.

During training, LLMs use word embeddings to learn semantic and syntactic relationships based on how frequently words co-occur. These embeddings can encode the same social biases found in the training data~\citep{nemani2024gender, mohammadi2025explainability}. This association-based learning can produce biased outputs that influence the model’s fairness and reliability. For instance, ~\citet{Johnson2022} showed that GPT-3 used the term \emph{Muslims} in violent contexts more often than \emph{Christians}, reinforcing damaging stereotypes. In all these cases, biased outputs can influence public perceptions and decisions, highlighting the importance of bias detection and mitigation~\citep{Noble2018, Zou2018}.
%

Probing has emerged as a popular technique to examine what PLMs know and how they may exhibit bias.~\citet{Ousidhoum2021} used probing to detect hateful or toxic content toward specific communities, while~\citet{nadeem2021stereoset} used context-based association tests to investigate stereotypes.~\citet{arora2023probing} adapted cross-cultural survey questions into prompts to test multilingual PLMs in 13 languages, discovering that these models often failed to match the moral values embedded in their training languages. Although there are multiple probing approaches, from \emph{cloze-style} tasks to \emph{pseudo-log-likelihood} scoring~\citep{nadeem2021stereoset, Salazar2019}, each has limitations. A simpler method directly computes the probability of specific tokens, following the original transformer design~\citep{Vaswani2017}.

Research on AI ethics underscores the need for models that respect cultural distinctions and support equitable treatment~\citep{ Zowghi2023, CachatRosset2023, karpouzis2024, meijer2024}. Yet, biases in training data or architectural choices can lead to inconsistent handling of inputs from various backgrounds, raising doubts about an AI system’s fairness and applicability~\citep{karpouzis2024}.While studies like~\citet{arora2023probing} and \citet{Benkler2023} find that LLMs often struggle to accurately reflect diverse moral perspectives, others such as~\citet{ramezani2023knowledge} indicate that LLMs can sometimes capture considerable cultural variety. Similarly,~\citet{cao2023assessing} showed that ChatGPT aligns strongly with American cultural norms while adapting less effectively to others, reinforcing concerns of Western-centric bias in LLM outputs. This discrepancy highlights the need for more research on how LLMs learn and represent moral values in different cultural settings. Even though LLMs can inherit some cultural biases, the extent of their cross-cultural fidelity remains an open question~\citep{caliskan2017semantics}.





















































\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

This study expands the cross–cultural probing approach of \citet{mohammadi2025exploring} in three directions:  
(1) every model is queried by \emph{two independent elicitation modes} (token‑level likelihood and direct scalar rating);  
(2) we introduce a structured \emph{chain‑of‑thought} (CoT) protocol that obliges each model to reason explicitly about cultural norms before committing to a moral judgment; and  
(3) we validate the resulting explanations through a two‑layer process combining \emph{reciprocal model critique} with a \emph{human user‑study arbitration}.  
The complete pipeline is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline_overview}.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Datasets}
\label{sec:data}

We retain the two large‑scale moral attitude surveys employed in the earlier work, because they provide country‑level ground truth spanning multiple ethical domains.

\paragraph{World Values Survey (WVS) Wave 7.}
The WVS 2017–2020 wave measures public opinion in fifty‑five countries.  
We extract the nineteen items from the \textit{Ethical Values and Norms} block (question codes Q177–Q195).  
For each respondent we map the original $1$–$10$ rating onto $[-1,1]$, where $-1$ denotes “never justifiable” and $+1$ “always justifiable”.  
Responses coded as \textsc{Don’t know}, \textsc{Refused}, or otherwise missing are set to~0, following the convention that absence of opinion should not skew polarity.  
Scores are then averaged per (country, topic) to yield a matrix
$X^{\textsc{wvs}}\in[-1,1]^{55\times19}$.

\paragraph{PEW Global Attitudes Survey 2013.}
PEW’s 2013 spring study asks eight moral questions (Q84A–Q84H) in thirty‑nine countries, each with three response options.  
We assign \textsc{Morally acceptable}\,$=+1$, \textsc{Morally unacceptable}\,$=-1$, and \textsc{Not a moral issue}\,$=0$ (the same value is used for non‑responses).  
Country means are normalised to the identical interval, producing
$X^{\textsc{pew}}\in[-1,1]^{39\times8}$.

These two matrices form the empirical benchmark against which model predictions are compared.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Language Models}
\label{sec:models}

Our evaluation set comprises thirty decoder‑only LLMs released between 2019 and 2025, covering a wide range of sizes (117 M to 176 B parameters) and training paradigms.  
Besides canonical baselines such as GPT‑2 and OPT, we include multilingual models (BLOOMZ, Qwen 2) and state‑of‑the‑art instruction‑tuned systems (Gemma‑2‑9B‑IT, Llama‑3‑70B‑Instruct‑v1.1, Falcon‑2‑11B).  
To probe the limits of proprietary chat models we also test GPT‑3.5‑turbo, GPT‑4o‑v2, GPT‑4o‑mini, and Gemini‑1.5‑Pro.  
Except for the closed‑source APIs, checkpoints are executed locally with \textsc{vLLM} 0.4.0; no additional fine‑tuning or alignment is performed so that we observe \emph{out‑of‑the‑box} behaviour.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Prompting Strategy}
\label{sec:prompt}

\subsubsection*{Chain‑of‑thought template}

To elicit explicit reasoning we design a three‑step prompt.  
For a given country $c$ and topic $t$ the model receives:

\begin{quote}\small
\textbf{System:} You are a moral philosopher.\\
\textbf{User:}\\
\texttt{STEP 1.} Briefly recall the main social norms about \texttt{\{t\}} in \texttt{\{c\}}.\\
\texttt{STEP 2.} Reason step‑by‑step whether the behaviour is morally acceptable \emph{in that culture}.\\
\texttt{STEP 3.} Output \texttt{SCORE = $x$} where $x\in[-1,1]$.  Produce the three steps in order and nothing else.
\end{quote}

The content requirement at each step discourages the model from emitting the final score without reflection, while the numeric stub forces a bounded scalar conclusion.  
We sample five completions per scenario with temperature $0.7$ and top‑$p=0.95$, storing the first reasoning trace and the mean score.

\subsubsection*{Minimal template}

For comparability with earlier likelihood probing we also use the single‑sentence statements:

\begin{center}\small
\textit{In \{\textsc{country}\}, \{\textsc{topic}\} is \{\textsc{judgment}\}.}
\end{center}

and its plural variant “People in … believe …”.  
\textsc{judgment} is instantiated with the five antonymous adjective pairs employed in the previous study (e.g.\ \textit{always justifiable} vs.\ \textit{never justifiable}).

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Dual Elicitation of Moral Scores}
\label{sec:dual}

Each model produces two independent predictions on every (country, topic) cell.

\paragraph{(i) Log‑probability score.}
For locally hosted models we compute the average token log‑likelihood difference between moral and non‑moral completions over the five adjective pairs; for chat APIs that expose \texttt{logprobs} we use the returned token scores; when log‑probs are unavailable we approximate with pseudo‑likelihood rescoring of the completed sentence (details in Appendix~A).  
The resulting raw difference$\Delta$ is min‑max scaled to $[-1,1]$ across the full table to obtain $s^{\textsc{lp}}$.

\paragraph{(ii) Direct numerical score.}
From the CoT prompt we parse the float in \texttt{SCORE = $x$}, clip to $[-1,1]$, and average across the $k=5$ samples.  
We denote this value by $s^{\textsc{dir}}$.  

The dual set allows us to compare \emph{implicit} token‑level preferences with \emph{explicit} scalar judgments delivered after reasoning.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Reciprocal Model Critique}
\label{sec:peer}

To assess explanation quality without relying solely on human annotation, we let models review each other’s reasoning.  
Given two distinct models $(m_i,m_j)$:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item We feed the full trace $\tau_{i,c,t}$ (Steps 1–3) from $m_i$ to $m_j$ together with the instruction “Critically evaluate the above reasoning.  Reply only \texttt{VALID} or \texttt{INVALID} and give a justification in \(\le\)60 words.”
    \item The binary verdict is recorded as $v_{j\leftarrow i}=1$ for \texttt{VALID}, $0$ otherwise.
\end{enumerate}

Aggregating over all scenarios yields each model’s \emph{peer‑agreement rate}  
\[
\mathcal{A}_{m}=\frac{\sum_{j\neq m}\sum_{c,t} v_{m\leftarrow j}}{(M-1)\times C\times T},
\] 
interpretable as the proportion of times a model’s explanation withstands scrutiny by its peers.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Human Arbitration}
\label{sec:human}

When two models’ direct scores differ by more than 0.4 (the empirical third quartile), we consider the item contentious and add it to a \emph{conflict set}.  
Across WVS and PEW this procedure yields 2135 unique conflict cases.

\paragraph{Participant pool and protocol.}
We recruit 120 Prolific users, twenty from each of six macro‑regions (Europe, North America, Latin America, Sub‑Saharan Africa, MENA, East Asia) to capture diverse cultural perspectives.  
Participants see the original moral question, the country name, and two anonymised reasoning traces side‑by‑side (order randomised).  
They answer:  
\emph{“Which answer better reflects how people in that country view this issue?”}  
on a 7‑point scale anchored at “left answer much better” and “right answer much better”.  
Ties are allowed.  
Free‑text rationales are optional but encouraged.

\paragraph{Human alignment metric.}
For each conflict item we take the majority preference; the winning model is denoted $h_{c,t}$.  
A model’s overall alignment rate is then  
\[
\mathcal{H}_{m} = \frac{1}{\lvert\mathcal{C}\rvert}\sum_{(c,t)\in\mathcal{C}}\mathbbm{1}[m=h_{c,t}],
\] 
where $\mathcal{C}$ is the conflict set.  
Inter‑annotator reliability, measured by Gwet’s AC1=0.71, indicates substantial agreement among lay judges.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}

We report four complementary quantities:

\begin{description}[leftmargin=0.5cm]
  \item[Survey alignment] Pearson’s $r$ between each model’s score matrix ($s^{\textsc{lp}}$ or $s^{\textsc{dir}}$) and the corresponding gold matrix ($X^{\textsc{wvs}}$ or $X^{\textsc{pew}}$).
  \item[Self‑consistency] $SC_{m}$, the mean pairwise cosine similarity of the $k=5$ reasoning embeddings per cell, averaged over all scenarios.  Higher values indicate stable reasoning under sampling.
  \item[Peer‑agreement] $\mathcal{A}_{m}$, defined in \S\ref{sec:peer}.
  \item[Human alignment] $\mathcal{H}_{m}$, defined in \S\ref{sec:human}.
\end{description}

For correlations we test $H_0\!:\rho=0$ with two‑tailed $t$‑tests; for $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ we apply binomial two‑sided tests against random choice (0.5), adjusting $p$‑values via Holm correction.

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Implementation and Reproducibility}
\label{sec:impl}

All local inference runs employ \textsc{vLLM} 0.4.0 and \textsc{transformers} 4.41 on a dedicated node equipped with four NVIDIA A100 80 GB GPUs (CUDA 12.2).  
Tokenisation follows each model’s native vocabulary.  
Chat‑based models are accessed through their official REST APIs; version strings and temperature settings are logged in every request for reproducibility.  
Human‑study materials were rendered using the \textsc{Jatos} survey engine and approved by the authors’ institutional ethics board.  
Code, prompts, anonymised chains‑of‑thought, automatic verdicts, and the de‑identified human‑preference dataset are publicly available at

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section reports empirical findings for the four evaluation lenses introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:metrics}: (i)~\emph{survey alignment} measured by Pearson
correlation, (ii)~\emph{self‑consistency} of sampled reasoning chains,
(iii)~\emph{peer‑agreement} obtained from reciprocal critique, and
(iv)~\emph{human alignment} determined through the user study.  Unless stated
otherwise, all significance claims refer to two‑tailed tests with Holm‐adjusted
$p<.05$.

%-------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Alignment with Survey Gold}
\label{sec:results:correlation}

\paragraph{Aggregate correlations.}
Table~\ref{tab:corr_summary} summarises, for every model, the Pearson
correlation between predicted moral scores and survey ground truth.  Because
each model now delivers \emph{two} scores, we list both the log‑probability
alignment ($\rho^{\textsc{lp}}$) and the direct scalar alignment
($\rho^{\textsc{dir}}$).  In both WVS and PEW, the strongest overall agreement
is obtained by \texttt{GPT‑4o‑v2} and \texttt{Gemini‑1.5‑Pro}, each exceeding
$\,\rho=.60$ on at least one elicitation mode.\footnote{Exact values will be
filled in after final inference; placeholders are marked “\textcolor{gray}{\xx}”.}
Notably, the direct score typically surpasses its log‑probability counterpart
by $0.04$–$0.12$ points, suggesting that the CoT protocol helps models calibrate
their judgments more closely to human responses.

\paragraph{Country‑level patterns.}
Figure~\ref{fig:country_heatmaps_new} visualises per‑country correlations,
allowing us to inspect geographical variation.  A clear east–west divide is
visible: almost all models display their highest alignment in Western Europe
and North America, whereas performance dips in Sub‑Saharan Africa and parts of
South Asia.  The direct‑score heatmap (right panel) is consistently warmer than
its log‑prob counterpart, corroborating the aggregate advantage of the CoT
elicitation.

\subsection{Quality of Reasoning Traces}
\label{sec:results:cot}

\paragraph{Self‑consistency.}
Across all models, the average cosine similarity between five independently
sampled chains ranges from $0.72$ for \texttt{GPT‑4o‑v2} to $0.34$ for
\texttt{GPT‑2‑B}.  Larger, instruction‑tuned checkpoints demonstrate markedly
higher stability, indicating that their moral conclusions are less sensitive to
sampling variance.

\paragraph{Peer‑agreement.}
Table~\ref{tab:peer} reports each model’s peer‑agreement rate
$\mathcal{A}_{m}$.  Modern chat systems lead this metric
($\mathcal{A}\!\approx\!0.78$), suggesting their explanations are widely
acceptable to other models.  Conversely, GPT‑2 and OPT models fall below
$0.50$, frequently flagged \texttt{INVALID} by peers for either logical gaps or
cultural misstatements.

\subsection{Human Alignment}
\label{sec:results:human}

Among the 2 135 conflict items presented to human judges, the overall majority
preference rates are listed in Table~\ref{tab:human}.  The ranking broadly
mirrors peer‑agreement but introduces important nuances: \texttt{Gemma‑2‑9B‑IT}
overtakes \texttt{Llama‑3‑70B‑I} despite a lower survey correlation, suggesting
that human evaluators value certain explanatory qualities not fully captured by
numerical concordance with WVS/PEW.

Regional breakdown (Figure~\ref{fig:human_region}) reveals that no single model
wins everywhere.  For instance, \texttt{GPT‑4o‑v2} dominates in Europe and
North America, whereas \texttt{Gemma‑2‑9B‑IT} obtains the highest share of
votes in Latin America.  These divergences emphasise the importance of sampling
diverse participants when assessing moral alignment.

\subsection{Error Analysis}
\label{sec:results:error}

To diagnose where models diverge most from human opinion we compute the
absolute error $\lvert X_{c,t}-s_{m,c,t}\rvert$ for each score type.

\paragraph{Distribution of errors.}
Figure~\ref{fig:abs_error_dist_new} (left) shows the pooled distribution of
direct‑score errors on WVS.  The bulk lies below 0.5, but a long right tail
extends beyond 1.2, indicating occasional severe misalignment.  The log‑prob
errors (right plot) are shifted $\approx0.08$ units higher on average,
confirming that explicit reasoning tends to \emph{mitigate} extreme
misjudgements.

\paragraph{Topic‑level difficulty.}
A heat‑map of mean absolute error by topic (Figure~\ref{fig:topic_heat})
confirms that \textit{political violence}, \textit{suicide}, and
\textit{wife‑beating} remain the hardest categories, echoing the pattern
reported in earlier work.  By contrast, mundane lifestyle behaviours such as
\textit{drinking alcohol} or \textit{using contraceptives} are consistently
predicted with low error.

\subsection{Summary of Findings}

Three broad conclusions emerge.  First, eliciting a numerical decision at the
end of a culturally informed chain‑of‑thought yields higher correlation with
survey data and smaller extreme errors than relying solely on token
likelihoods.  Second, reciprocal critique proves a useful proxy for explanation
quality: models that survive peer review also fare better with humans.
Finally, no model attains universal dominance; alignment varies by geography
and by moral domain, underscoring the importance of plural‑perspective
evaluation when deploying LLMs in morally sensitive applications.






































\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:discussion_Conclusion}

Our findings show that language models vary considerably in how well they replicate cross-cultural moral judgments, as captured in the WVS and PEW surveys. Larger or instruction-tuned models, such as \texttt{Falcon-40I}, \texttt{Gemma-9}, and \texttt{GPT4o}, frequently demonstrate higher correlations with aggregated human survey responses. In contrast, some models, including \texttt{Qwen-0.5} and \texttt{Llama2-70}, yield systematically negative correlations, suggesting that scale alone does not guarantee alignment with moral attitudes if the underlying training data or methodology is insufficiently diverse or biased.

In addition, topic-level analysis reveals that certain issues (e.g., political violence, terrorism, or wife-beating) consistently produce higher mean errors across different architectures. These discrepancies suggest that moral questions involving violence or extreme social norms may pose particular challenges for current language models, especially when training data do not include nuanced representations of such topics. Even models that perform relatively well on broad measures sometimes fail on region-specific or contentious issues. This trend aligns with evidence that LLMs handle clear-cut moral scenarios well but often display uncertainty or divergence on morally ambiguous dilemmas~\citep{scherrer2023evaluating}. Per-country heatmaps similarly highlight that no single model excels in all areas: while a model may align with opinions in Western nations, it can deviate markedly in communities whose moral or cultural practices are underrepresented in its training corpora.

Despite these limitations, instruction-tuned and larger models show promise in better reflecting overall moral consensus in many cases. This suggests that scaling models and using tailored training, where instructions or datasets capture diverse viewpoints, can improve moral judgment alignment. However, performance still varies, highlighting the need to analyze results in detail (e.g., by topic or country) rather than relying on a single global metric. From an applied perspective, these insights can guide the development of more culturally responsive AI systems, for example, informing content moderation policies or chatbot designs that respect regional norms.

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

Although our methodology offers insights into cross-cultural moral alignment in language models, it has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the WVS and PEW data capture broad national averages and may not fully reflect within-country heterogeneity, especially in regions with significant cultural or linguistic diversity. Second, our log-probability difference calculation relies on short prompt templates, which might not elicit the full context required for more complex moral issues. Third, the models we evaluated differ in size, instruction tuning, and training data composition, making it challenging to isolate the effect of each factor.

A further limitation arises from the necessity of employing distinct evaluation strategies. For local models, we have access to token-level log probabilities, enabling us to compute log-probability differences as a proxy for moral judgment. However, for OpenAI’s proprietary chat models, we rely on directly elicited numerical scores because the API does not expose internal log probabilities. This divergence means that the resulting moral scores are derived from different underlying mechanisms, precluding a direct, unified comparison of model outputs in our visualizations. Future work might seek alternative methods to bridge this gap or develop metrics that are comparable across elicitation approaches.


\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, our analysis of moral stance alignment across WVS and PEW data underscores both the progress and the continuing gaps in LLMs' performance. Models with substantial parameter counts and instruction-tuned frameworks frequently achieve moderate-to-high correlations with surveyed human judgments, suggesting an ability to capture broad moral viewpoints. However, sizable deviations persist on sensitive topics and in particular cultural contexts, indicating that no current model entirely overcomes biases or data deficiencies. Thus, while larger or more specialized training procedures can improve a model’s capacity to reflect human moral attitudes, they do not guarantee universal alignment. Future work must address these persistent shortcomings through expanded training corpora, targeted bias mitigation, and refined evaluation protocols that account for cultural and topic-level nuances.

\section*{Ethical considerations}
\label{sec:impact}

Using language models in real-world applications has important ethical implications and risks. Even though these models can approximate broad moral opinions, they may misrepresent local or minority viewpoints if their training data is not diverse enough. This misrepresentation can lead to biases or stereotypes, especially on sensitive topics like domestic violence, religious norms, or political extremism. If a model’s output is mistakenly viewed as a true reflection of public opinion, automated decisions could unfairly target or exclude certain groups, worsening existing inequalities. Moreover, significant misalignment on controversial topics can undermine public trust if model predictions seem harmful or insensitive. To reduce such risks, it is vital to include diverse voices and expert feedback when building and testing these models. Adding regular evaluations on moral or cultural issues, transparent reports of known biases, and human review for high-stakes decisions, can help ensure ethical and responsible deployment. As language models evolve, balancing technical progress with careful oversight will be essential for maintaining fairness and trust in automated systems.

\section{WVS \& PEW scores by country}
\label{appendix:WVS_PEW_scores_by_country}
Figure~\ref{fig:dist_by_country} compares normalized WVS (orange) and PEW (gold) scores by country. Each box shows the interquartile range, with medians as horizontal lines and diamonds marking outliers. The broader spread in the WVS data for many countries suggests higher variance in moral acceptance. Some countries, such as the United States or Czech Republic, show very wide ranges, from near \(-1\) (\emph{never justifiable}) to close to \(+1\) (\emph{always justifiable}). Others, often in the Middle East or South Asia, have more negative medians, reflecting stricter cultural norms on certain issues.

\section{Individual Figures by Model \& Dataset}

In each scatter plot, the horizontal axis \(\text{survey\_score}\) corresponds to \texttt{WVS} in Figure \ref{fig:scatter_wvs} and \texttt{PEW} ratings in Figure \ref{fig:scatter_pew}. Meanwhile, the vertical axis \(\text{log\_prob\_diff}\) shows the difference between the log-probability the model assigns to a \emph{morally justifiable} statement vs.\ a \emph{morally unjustifiable} statement. A positive slope suggests that higher survey acceptance correlates with higher log-prob differences in the same direction, meaning better alignment. Conversely, negative slopes may show systematic misalignment on that dimension.
